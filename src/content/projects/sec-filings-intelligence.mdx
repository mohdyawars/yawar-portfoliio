## Context

Public companies publish SEC EDGAR filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K) that are extremely long, inconsistently structured, and difficult to analyze manually. Investment research workflows require extracting relevant sections and generating concise, accurate summaries without introducing hallucinations.

This system serves as **decision-support infrastructure** for investment research—not a document processing utility.

## Primary Challenges

### Token Limits
- Filings often exceed hundreds of pages
- LLMs have strict context window limitations
- Naive summarization loses critical financial details

### Document Variance
- Inconsistent formatting across companies and filing types
- Section headers vary by company and filer
- Tables, footnotes, and exhibits require special handling

### LLM Reliability
- High risk of hallucination in financial text
- Investment decisions require deterministic, repeatable summaries
- Need for guardrails that don't compromise usefulness

## Architecture

The system follows a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** approach:

1. **Ingestion Layer**: Fetches filings from SEC EDGAR API
2. **Parsing Layer**: Segments filings by logical sections using heuristics and document structure
3. **Chunking Layer**: Splits sections into LLM-safe token chunks with overlap for context continuity
4. **Embedding Layer**: Generates vector embeddings stored in ChromaDB
5. **Retrieval Layer**: Semantic search for relevant chunks based on query
6. **Generation Layer**: LLM summarization with retrieved context

## Key Design Decisions

### Section-Based Parsing vs Full-Document Processing
Full-document summarization was explicitly avoided. SEC filings contain boilerplate, legal disclaimers, and repetitive content that dilutes signal. Section-based parsing allows:
- Targeted extraction (Risk Factors, MD&A, Financial Statements)
- Reduced token usage
- More focused summaries

### Chunking Strategy
Chunks are sized to fit within token limits with 10-15% overlap. This ensures:
- No information loss at boundaries
- Context continuity for the LLM
- Predictable token consumption

### Embedding-Based Retrieval vs Keyword Search
Semantic search via embeddings handles:
- Synonym variations across filers
- Conceptually related content
- Query expansion without explicit rules

### Hallucination Guardrails
- Source citations in every generated summary
- Confidence scoring for generated claims
- Human-in-the-loop review for high-stakes outputs
- Explicit "unknown" responses when context is insufficient

## Explicit Tradeoffs

### What This System Does NOT Do
- Real-time streaming of new filings (batch processing only)
- Quantitative financial modeling or valuation
- Legal or compliance advice

### Known Limitations
- Heavily formatted tables may lose structure in parsing
- Very long filings may require multiple retrieval rounds
- LLM latency makes interactive use slower than search

### Failure Cases Considered
- Malformed or corrupt filings: graceful skip with logging
- Embedding service downtime: queue for retry
- LLM rate limits: backoff and batch scheduling

## Frontend Integration

A minimal React interface supports research workflows:

- **Filing Search** — Filter by company, filing type, date range
- **Summary Viewer** — Display generated summaries with source citations
- **Chunk Explorer** — Review retrieved sections that informed the summary

The frontend is intentionally simple—its purpose is to surface backend-generated analysis, not to showcase UI complexity.

## Outcome

The system enables:
- **Faster analysis**: Hours of manual reading reduced to minutes
- **Repeatable summaries**: Same filing, same query, consistent output
- **Clear correctness boundaries**: Users know what the system can and cannot reliably answer

This is not a magic "understand everything" tool. It's infrastructure that makes human analysts more efficient while maintaining transparency about its limitations.
